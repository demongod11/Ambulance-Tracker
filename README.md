# Smart Siren (Ambulance-Tracker) üöë

This web app assists hospitals by bridging the communication gap between Ambulance driver and hospital management especially during emergency cases. This web app successfully tracks and alerts hospital management by which delay in treatment of patient can be reduced. This could potentially save lives.

This webapp notifies hospital when an ambulance is within 3km range of a hospital. This will be very useful at times of emergency cases which assists in timely treatement of patients. This works by tracking ambulance location(coordinates) in real-time. The location stats will also be updated in realtime on hospital's display board.

This webapp was built using `ReactJS`, `Node.js`, `Express`, `MongoDB`, `Socket.io`, `Geo-location API`, `TailwindCSS`.

To install the webapp, run the following commands:-

    - git clone https://github.com/Yaswanth820/Ambulance-tracker.git
    - npm install (in server, clients folders)

To initialize the project follow the below steps:- 

    - Download and install MongoDB compass 
    - Create a database with <DB_NAME> in the MongoDB compass application
    - Create a .env file in the server folder with the following details DB_URI=https://localhost:27017/<DB_NAME>

Run the project => `npm start`
